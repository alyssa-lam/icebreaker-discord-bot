# Ice Breaker Discord Bot
This is my first little project ever and I worked together with my friend Corinne.
The [Ice Breaker](https://top.gg/bot/838686730428088351) Discord Bot is a basic conversation starter consisting of several question/game packs and is a great way to get to know the users on your Discord server. The bot is coded in Python using the discord.py library. We used repl.it, a collaborative browser based IDE, to code and host the bot.

Packs include: 
- Ice breaker for kids, coworkers and a spicy version for friends
- Never have I ever
- This or That
- Truth or Dare
- Would you rather

I have not made them public but if you want the question text files, contact me!
